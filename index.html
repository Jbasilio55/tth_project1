            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I’m an aspiring Front End / Full Stack Software Engineer who loves everything about the web. I've worked in lots of different jobs, and gained valuable experience, and have become a natural problem solver. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic-looking websites.</p>
            <p>I’ve been a Volunteer Police Officer for my home town New Brunswick, and held a professional role as a Lead Security Officer at a Level 1 Trauma Center and am a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p>
